  OZ 4WD Adventures offer Tag-Along Tours specialising in trips within South
  Australia. Our knowledge of touring the outback and coastal areas of Australia
  commenced in 1985. We provide safety and professionalism to ensure you take
  away the best experiences and memories of your trip with us, sharing our
  knowledge of four wheel driving within South Australia.


  Our guided Tag-Along tour adventures have a variety of tours all prepared
  using safety guidelines. We carry all the necessary recovery gear, satellite
  telephone for your safety (emergencies only) and GPS navigation equipment.


  We include the following:


  * Camping and accommodation fees where applicable.

  * Private station 4WD track fees.

  * National park entrance fees, desert parks passes and aboriginal lands
  permits.


  We are accredited in senior first aid with an emergency remote area first aid
  kit on board. Part of our package is to provide our customers with a list of
  necessary equipment, vehicle requirements and some general safe travelling
  rules. We will plan the trip itinerary; provide advice for trip preparation
  and safe outback travel while ensuring you visit all the best, sometimes
  unknown places whilst having a memorable experience.


  The majority of our tours are self-catered and camping style to ensure your
  costs are kept to a minimum. Included is a first night barbeque and over the
  tour I'll muster up a damper or two.


  If you have your own idea for a trip and require us to assist in planning and
  guiding your trip, we are happy to help. If you have any queries about our
  tours and want to have a chat, please call, email or [contact us](/contact).
  If we are on a tour when you enquire, our voicemail or out of office email
  notice will advise you of our return date. We will ensure we make contact with
  you ASAP.
