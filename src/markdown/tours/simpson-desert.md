      To commence your adventure with OZ 4WD Adventures you will depart Adelaide
      at 8.30am driving through Saddleworth, Clare, Jamestown and taking a brief
      lunch and refuel stop at Hawker. From here you will head towards Lyndhurst
      with the Flinders Ranges in the distance, stopping at Lyndhurst to refuel
      and to visit Talc Alf. From Lyndhurst there is a short drive to your
      destination for the day being Farina. While you're exploring, we will
      prepare an Aussie-style BBQ for your evening meal.


      Farina originally called The Gums or Government Gums, Farina was settled
      in 1878 by optimistic farmers hoping that rain follows the plough. The
      town was the railhead for a time until 1884 before the railway was
      extended to Marree. During the wet years of the 1880s, plans were laid out
      for a town with 432 ¼-acre blocks. It was believed that it would be good
      for growing wheat and barley, however normal rainfall was nowhere near
      enough to grow these crops. Several silver and copper mines were dug in
      the surrounding area.


      Farina grew to reach a peak population of approximately 600 in the late
      1800s. In its heyday, the town had two hotels (the Transcontinental and
      the Exchange) and an underground bakery, a bank, two breweries, a general
      store, an Anglican church, five blacksmiths, a school and a brothel. In
      1909, a 1,143 kilograms (2,520 lb) iron meteorite was discovered
      north-east of the town.


      Today, nothing but stone ruins and the elevated railway water tank remain
      of the township. The post office closed in the 1960s and the railway line
      closed in the 1980s.


      The town is no longer inhabited, with the closest residents now living at
      Farina station, visible to the west of the town. A bush camping area is
      maintained by the owners of Farina station.


      In 2008 Farina Restoration Group was formed, and in May 2009, 30 people
      attended a 14-day restoration program at Farina.


      Volunteer efforts have been made to restore the town, including the repair
      of the underground bakery which generally now operates but is currently
      closed due to Covid 19.

    name: Adelaide to Farina

      Departing Farina at 9am we will travel to Marree which is a fascinating
      historic watering hole and railway town. While at Marree, take time to
      visit the yacht Club, the Railway, the iconic Tom Cruise's postal truck
      and the Marree Hotel which is full of historic information. Marree is a
      legendary outback town at the junction of the Birdsville and Oodnadatta
      Tracks. 


      Leaving Marree we will stop at some interesting locations such as the
      Cooper Creek Flood Plain campground and the barge used to carry supplies
      across the Cooper Creek in flood, before arriving at our evening
      destination at the Mungerannie Hotel.


      The Birdsville Track is a notable outback road in Australia. The 517
      kilometres track runs between Birdsville in South-Western Queensland and
      Marree, a small town in the north-eastern part of South Australia. It
      traverses 3 deserts along the route, the Strzelecki Desert, Sturt Stony
      Desert and Tirari Desert.


      Mungerannie offers a welcoming atmosphere, a chance to have a hot shower,
      hotel cooked food (not included in tour) a drink to relax. The proprietor,
      Phil Gregurke has many interesting stories and one of my favourites, the
      gambler.


      Fuel available at Mungerannie approx. $1.95/lt

      Departing Birdsville we will continue to Big Red which is 40 metres in
      height, and situated just 35 kilometre from Birdsville; the famous Big Red
      Sand Dune provides a challenge for any four wheel drive enthusiast. The
      first of 1,140 parallel dunes in the Simpson Desert, the spectacular
      sunsets from the top of Big Red provide many photo opportunities. After a
      play on Big red we will continue towards Poeppel Corner.


      As we continue we will get into sand hill country and the vegetation is
      very sparse. As we enter into the National Park the terrain changes, lots
      of dead trees and flat clay pans in the swales of the Sand hills. The road
      conditions will change many times, with corrugations, sand and ruts as we
      head to Poeppel Corner.


      Poeppel Corner, a landmark junction between Queensland, Southern Australia
      and Northern Territory is a heritage listed site, proudly marked by a
      vintage sign mounted right where the 3 regions (and their respective time
      zones) meet. 


      Poeppel Corner is surrounded by miles and miles of bewitching desert
      landscape, featuring giant dunes that often rise to 90 m in height. In
      fact, Simpson Desert was recently renamed Munga Thirri, or ‘Big Red Sand
      Dune Country’. This breathtaking sampling of the outback comes with equal
      measures of geological, ecological and historical significance. Besides
      serving as the natural habitat for hundreds of species of birds, mammals
      and reptiles, the area has been home to multiple aboriginal tribes, who
      survived the extreme temperatures and the arid conditions of the desert
      via brilliant indigenous techniques.


      Tonights camp location is determined by how group is travelling.

  - description: >-
      Set off from Poeppel Corner, we will tackle the 1100 sand dunes of the
      Simpson desert, our speed has now been reduced to an average of 17 Kms/hr.
      Your journey will include crossing dry lake beds, salt pans and
      gibber-ironstone flats. Keep an eye out for the local wildlife such as
      camels, dingoes, goannas and the thorny devil lizards. It’s out here that
      we also get to see Australia’s wonderful native wildflowers. 


      It is optional to attempt the steep sand dunes or take the chicken track
      as they are known, plenty of photo opportunities of the breathtaking
      views. The campsite tonight is another bush camp under a magnificent star
      filled sky.


      Communication is important as we are spread across multiple sand dunes, so
      if you require a break or a photo opportunity presents itself we encourage
      you to call over the UHF Radio and inform us.


      **165Kms**
    name: Poeppel Corner towards Purni Bore
  - description: >-
      Our journey will continue along the French Line to Purni Bore (toilet
      facilities only), which was originally sunk by a French Petroleum Oil
      Company in 1964 as a strati graphic well. It now sustains large numbers of
      wildlife in the area.  Land management decided to cap the bore, but
      lobbying from environmentalists resulted in a compromise where the flow
      was minimised and the wetland environment continues to provide an oasis
      for desert species.


      Dalhousie Hot Springs, a delightful oasis in the middle of nowhere, and
      time to set up camp and enjoy the natural surrounds of this unique and
      beautiful place. You’ll have time to relax and soak in the warm waters
      from the Great Artesian Basin spring ready to soothe your aches and pains
      away.

      Pack up camp and head off after a last minute soak before dragging
      ourselves away from Mother Nature’s hot water springs and continue on to
      the fascinating old ruins of Dalhousie Homestead with its 100 year old
      date palms. As we travel towards Oodnadatta (163 Kms), an opportunity to
      stop and walk around the old railway sidings, refuel at Oodnadatta at the
      Pink Roadhouse before continuing on to Algebuckina Railway.


      Leaving Oodnadatta we travel down the Birdsville Track to Algebuckina
      Railway Bridge.

      Departing Algebuckina Railway Bridge to William Creek continuing down the
      Oodnadatta track for 7 Kms and turn off on the Halligan Bay track to drive
      to Lake Eyre (a massive salt lake which is 144 Km long and 77 Km wide),
      then returning to the Oodnadatta track where we continue south stopping at
      Mutonia Sculpture Park and Coward Springs Campground. Travel out to Wabma
      Kadarbu Mound Springs Conservation Park (Bubbler and Blanche Cup springs),
      before heading out to Muloorina Station (South of Lake Eyre). This is a
      magnificent campsite on the banks of a bore-fed billabong that is part of
      the Frome River. The billabong is an oasis filled with green reeds that
      attracts an array of wonderful bird life including brolgas, brown kites,
      whistling kites, great egrets, corellas, galahs, budgies, swifts, diamond
      doves, sacred kingfisher, white-breasted wood swallow, babblers, honey
      eaters, eurasian coot, pacific black duck, black-fronted dotterel, zebra
      finch, black-face cuckoo-shrike, welcome swallow, crested pigeon, magpies,
      and herons. There is a good bird habitat surrounding the waterhole with
      plenty of scrub, mature trees and reed beds. A permanent bird hide is
      located on the homestead side of the waterhole. The eastern (far) side of
      the waterhole are hot pools. They are fairly hot and silty bottom. Swim
      across the waterhole, laze in the hot pool, cool off on the swim back.

      Farina to home, our last leg of the trip, so before departing Farina if
      you haven't already taken time to venture up to the Anzac Memorial,
      cemetery and old ruins . The road from here is all bitumen so pump your
      tyres back up if you haven't already done so at Marree.


      There is fuel at Lyndhurst, the hotel seems to always have the best price
      or if you have enough continue through to Hawker where we can grab a bite
      from the bakery and a nice coffee.


      From Hawker we will travel through to Port Augusta and turn south towards
      Adelaide.


      Bakery is currently closed due to Covid 19.
