      road that links the towns of Lyndhurst to Innamincka and ventures near the
      Santos Oil and Gas plant known as Moomba. The Strzelecki Track is
      programmed to become a sealed road in the future. We will do a diversion
      onto the Old Strzelecki Track, known locally as the Limestone Creek Road
      near the Merty Merty Homestead. Travelling up the Strzelecki Track we will
      venture into the Innamincka Reserve, depending on time, we may even get to
      do the top end of the Bore Track to our destination for the night at the
      Cullyamurra Water Hole (long drop toilets available). The Cullyamurra
      Waterhole, near Innamincka, is Australia's largest billabong (7 kms long
      and a staggering 27 metres deep). An opportunity to wet a line and catch a
      freshwater fish.

    name: Gammon Ranges to Cullyamurra Water Hole via the Strzelecki Track
  - description: >-
      The Cullyamurra Waterhole is Australia’s largest billabong at 7kms long
      and a staggering 28 metres deep. It was formed after massive floods of the
      Cooper Creek were restricted at what is now known as the ‘Innamincka
      Choke,’ where the turbulence from the raging water gouged out the riverbed
      to form a deep channel. The waterhole has never known to be dry and is
      deeper in parts than most of Sydney Harbour.


      Like most of the Innamincka Regional Reserve, Cullyamurra Waterhole is
      alive with wildlife and is a bird watchers paradise. Yellowbelly and
      catfish are plentiful and if fishing isn’t your thing, the waterhole is
      famous for some of the most stunning sunsets in the outback. Leave camp
      set up to venture to Cullyamurra Water Hole and visit The Burke & Wills
      Dig Tree which is one of Australia's National icons and an enduring
      reminder of the pioneering spirit and extreme harshness of the Outback.
      Nappa Merrie Station is proud to officially manage the site on behalf of
      the Royal Historical Society of Queensland. Located on the northern bank
      of Cooper Creek, the Dig Tree is a Coolibah (Eucalyptus microtha).


      In 1898, John Dick carved Burke's face into another tree (the Face Tree)
      about 30 metres downstream of the Dig Tree. The site is as Burke & Wills
      and companions would have viewed it nearly 140 years ago. These trees are
      direct a link to the explorers of Australia's Historic Past.


      Continuing our journey to Innamincka to top up with fuel and a bit of
      local sightseeing.

      Depart Cullyamurra Waterhole and venture out to Malkumba-Coongie Lakes
      National Park is one of the most spectacular of South Australia's natural
      attractions. The park is a pristine water world made up of channels,
      waterholes, lakes, internal deltas, shallow floodplains and interdune
      corridors and swamps. Motorboats, camp fires, fishing and generators are
      not permitted in the park, ensuring a genuine wilderness experience.


      Coongie Lakes is listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance.
      The waterbird diversity is high for an arid wetland and is a significant
      feeding, resting and breeding site for an enormous number of birds that
      migrate to the area. The wetland plays host to a diversity of wildlife
      including fish, reptiles and frogs. It transforms into a breeding ground
      for an enormous number of migratory birds from around the world. The
      contrast from sand dunes to vast wetlands is remarkable. The park is a
      true wilderness for visitors seeking a place of solitude to enjoy nature.


      From Coongie Lakes National Park and return to Cullyamurra Water Hole.

      Departing Cullyamurra Waterhole we travel along the Fifteen Mile Track
      which runs for 60km, mainly sand and bulldust holes, with detours to the
      site where John King was found alive on 15th September 1861 and another
      where explorer William Wills died on 29th June 1861. It’s still sobering
      to read about the ill-fated Burke & Wills expedition, especially the
      struggles Burke, Wills and King faced after missing their support party by
      hours at the Dig Tree further upstream of Cooper Creek. Once across the
      Cooper, the track looks like an insignificant station track disappearing
      into the endless sand dunes and gibber plains. The landscape changes with
      Coolabah trees and sand dunes dominating. The corrugations increased and
      on one sharp bend there is a bra tree, so don't get distracted and miss
      the bend. The sand changes from blinding white to burnt orange the further
      north we travel, and the dunes got higher. The track followed the swales
      between the dunes before entering the Sturt Stony Desert. The closer you
      get to the Birdsville Track junction, the more the conditions deteriorate,
      travel speed will drop right off. This is due to the sharp rocks that
      litter the track, this track is due west and best not to be done in the
      late of the day as your blinded by the sun. Once at the Birdsville track
      intersection we will travel south roughly 190 kms down the Birdsville
      Track to the Mungerannie Hotel. The Birdsville Track is a notable outback
      road in Australia. The 517 kilometres track runs between Birdsville in
      south-western Queensland and Marree, a small town in the north-eastern
      part of South Australia. It traverses three deserts along the route, the
      Strzelecki Desert, Sturt Stony Desert and Tirari Desert.


      Mungerannie offers a welcoming atmosphere, a chance to have a hot shower,
      hotel cooked food (not included in tour) a drink and relaxation. The
      proprietor Phil Gregurke has many interesting stories and one of my
      favourites is the gambler.


      Fuel available at Mungerannie approx. 1.95/lt

      the Birdsville Track.
  - description: "Departing Mungerannie, we will stop at some interesting locations such as the Cooper Creek Flood plain campground and the barge used to carry supplies across the Cooper in flood. Marree a legendary outback town at the junction of the Birdsville and Oodnadatta Tracks. Marree is a fascinating historic watering hole and railway town on the way to Farina Old Ruins (toilets and showers available).\n\nWhile at Marree visit the yacht Club, the Railway, the iconic Tom Cruise's Postal truck and the Maree Hotel which is full of historic information.\n\nContinuing to Farina for our nights camp you will have time to walk amongst the old towns ruins and visit the cemetery which is very enlightening to how harsh this country is. \n\nOriginally called The Gums or Government Gums, Farina was settled in 1878 by optimistic farmers hoping that rain follows the plough. The town was the railhead for a time until 1884 before the railway was extended to Marree. During the wet years of the 1880s, plans were laid out for a town with 432 ¼-acre blocks. It was believed that it would be good for growing wheat and barley, however normal rainfall is nowhere near enough to grow these crops. Several silver and copper mines were dug in the surrounding area.\r\n\nFarina grew to reach a peak population of approximately 600 in the late 1800s. In its heyday, the town had two hotels (the Transcontinental and the Exchange) and an underground bakery, a bank, two breweries, a general store, an Anglican church, five blacksmiths, a school and a brothel. In 1909, a 1,143 kilograms (2,520 lb) iron meteorite was discovered north-east of the town.\r\n\n\rToday nothing but stone ruins and the elevated railway water tank remain of the township. The post office closed in the 1960s and the railway line closed in the 1980s.\r\n\nThe town is no longer inhabited, with the closest residents now living at Farina station, visible to the west of the town. A bush camping area is maintained by the owners of Farina station.\r\n\n\rIn 2008 Farina Restoration Group was formed, and in May 2009, 30 people attended a 14-day restoration program at Farina.\n\n\rVolunteer efforts have been made to restore the town, including the repair of the underground bakery which generally now operates but is currently closed due to Covid 19. \n\nFuel available at Marree or Lyndhurst\n\n**261 kms**"

      Farina to home, our last leg of the trip, so before departing Farina if
      you haven't already taken time to venture up to the Anzac Memorial,
      cemetery and old ruins . The road from here is all bitumen so pump your
      tyres back up if you haven't already done so at Marree.


      There is fuel at Lyndhurst, the hotel seems to always have the best price
      or if you have enough continue through to Hawker where we can grab a bite
      from the bakery and a nice coffee.


      From Hawker we will travel through to Port Augusta and turn south towards
      Adelaide.


      Bakery is currently closed due to Covid 19.
